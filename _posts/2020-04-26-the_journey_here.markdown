 Why did you decide to learn software development?
 
 
    Software Engineering was never on my radar until halfway thru my undergrad. My major was in Fine Art Photography/Digital Media but I got very experimental with my practice halfway thru. I started looking at live coding after seeing some amazing projection mappings and interactive visuals that artists were doing at the time. That started me on the path to learning javascript which was the language used in the Processing coding enviornment. I took some online courses and went thru tons of free online resources just so I could learn how to create audio reactive visuals and projection mappings that you can physically interact with. I spent hours upon hours on my computer teaching myself how to hack a kinect camera and my laptop's webcam in order to make animations that I could command with the movement of my hands or my body. I failed so many times but it was just so addictive to me because when I would finally get things to work the end result was so satisfying and my audience and viewers really enjoyed it as well. 
		Beyond photography and digital media my background is in music. I am a self taught DJ/Producer and guitarist...and just a musician in general. Suddenly in my undergrad, coding was able to tie both of my big interests together in a way that making videos or animations just wasn't doing. The world of programming also really opened my eyes to the open-source community online and the myriad of ways in which you could really learn starting from zero. That inspired me to be a part of that community because I really do believe sharing knowledge is the true path to success in our world and in our future. It just felt really cool to me.
		Education has been a hard thing to come by. Pursuing an art degree, while really fun, has been too expensive and has had very little in return in terms of a career but what I did find was a clearer path to a new calling. The whole coding experience really took me for a dive into my own self and how I function as an artist and designer and how I see myself playing those roles. I realized after learning javascript that this language wasn't just for making animations but was used for writing the whole web. This left me very inspired to look into web development as a possible next step.
		I graduated from my BFA in 2014 and what I have learned about myself over these past several years is that process is key to how I work and function in anything that I choose to do. Being able to sit down, focus and follow a step-by-step process to acheive a finished product is everything to me. Some may call that plain and simple discipline or maybe its just craftmanship, but those sort of characteristics are precisely what Im looking for out of my dream job. 
		I chose Software Engineering as a new path because I believe I do have the interest and the creativity to use coding and the web as a medium to express new ideas to the world. In turn, coding itself nourishes my need to stay focused, to pay attention to process and to problem solve. I see it as way to keep my mind in check while being able to harness my own talents and interests all into one place. I believe that learning and mastering web development also unlocks a door to the future of our world which is a topic that I have much interest in. I never had a computer growing up because my family just didn't have the means for one so I feel very priveleged now to have come this far from zero. I hope I can pass the torch to others one day and thats also a big reason for why Im here today.
